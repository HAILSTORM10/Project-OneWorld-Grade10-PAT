# OneWorld-Grade10-PAT
Grade 10 PAT focussed on Language Learning

Language barriers are a problem faced by people the world over that interferes with our ability to connect and engage with people of other cultures both socially and formally. 
This limits our opportunities to grow as people and even as a global community, especially in our modern, diverse era where you could be interacting with and learning from a variety of people online.

Language barriers are the problem Project: OneWorld tries to aid in fixing, because at the end of the day, we are one world, and language can’t change that.
